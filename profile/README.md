# Dashlane: Under the Hood üõ†Ô∏è

We are the creators of the Dashlane Password Manager. In our public repositories you will find the source code for our mobile apps. We have also developed a [CLI version of Dashlane](https://github.com/Dashlane/dashlane-cli), while not officially supported it is created by us at Dashlane.


Many of the technical details of our product can be found in our white paper here:

Details in the white paper include:

- The use of [Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) for key derivation
- How 2FA is used to protect account access
- The use of public-key cryptography for sharing items
